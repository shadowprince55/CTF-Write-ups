This room was all about scanning. It talked about ports, active and passive scanning.
Tools such as nmap, nessus, nikto, etc were also introduced.

On deploying the room, I first completed an nmap scan to get a sense of the running ports.
On completing a Nikto scan, I was able to determine the name of the http server.

In order to find the flag, I searched for smb://MACHINE_IP in the files. I was then able to get the flag and the list of passwords.

Overall, a fun room to get acquainted with basics.
